DigitClassifier
===============

Benchmarks various methods of handwritten digit classification using images from the MNIST dataset. 

Usage:

    ~ $ cd DigitClassifier/scripts
    ~ $ python ml_benchmark.py

**WARNING**: Since k-nearest neighbors is incredibly slow, this will eat your RAM and CPU. But, it's for 
autonomous digit classification, so it's totally worth it.

## Supervised Methods 
- K nearest neighbors
- Random Forest

## Unsupervised Methods
- (TODO) K-means clustering
